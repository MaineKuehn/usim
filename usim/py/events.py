"""
This module provides the fundamental event types of SimPy:
:py:class:`~usim.py.events.Event`, :py:class:`~usim.py.events.Timeout` and
:py:class:`~usim.py.events.Process`.
All events are subclasses of :py:class:`~usim.py.events.Event`.

Simulations react to events by adding :py:attr:`~usim.py.events.Event.callbacks`
or by having a :py:class:`~usim.py.events.Process` ``yield`` an event to wait for.
A native μSim simulation can react to events by having an :term:`activity`
``await`` an event.

    """
    Explicitly triggered Event that processes can wait for

    An :py:class:`~.Event` is triggered by :py:meth:`~.succeed` or :py:meth:`~.fail`.
    Triggering wakes up every :py:class:`~.Process` or :py:class:`~usim.typing.Task`
    that is suspended waiting for the event. In addition, a :py:class:`~.Process` may
    add to an event's :py:attr:`~.callbacks` to trigger actions alongside the event.

    .. code:: python3

        def track(event: Event):
            print('Waiting for %s' % event)
            yield event
            print('Notified by %s' % event)

        def trigger(event: Event):
            event.success("Jolly Good!")

    Once triggered, :py:attr:`~.value` is set either to the result or failure reason.
    Use :py:attr:`~.triggered`, :py:attr:`~.processed`, and :py:attr:`~.ok` to inspect
    what state an event is in.

    .. hint::

        **Migrating to μSim**

        When migrating from :py:class:`~.Process` to :py:class:`~usim.typing.Task`,
        both can wait for an event. Use ``await event`` inside an :term:`Activity`:

        .. code:: python3

            async def track(event: Event):
                print(f'Waiting for {event}')
                await event
                print(f'Notified by {event}')

        The value is returned on success of the event, and raised on failure.

        When migrating the :py:class:`~.Event`, the best match is :py:class:`usim.Flag`.
        A flag has no dedicated :py:attr:`~.value`, but represents a boolean.

        .. code:: python3

            async def track(flag: Flag):
                print(f'Waiting for {flag}')
                await flag
                print(f'Notified by {flag}')

            async def trigger(flag: Flag):
                await event.set()

        In order to send values between activities, use a :py:class:`usim.basics.Queue`
        or :py:class:`usim.basics.Channel`. These allow to send and wait for messages.

        .. code:: python3

            async def receiver(queue: Queue):
                print('Waiting for a message to reach us...')
                message = await queue
                print(f'And the message is: {message}')

            async def sender(queue: Queue):
                await queue.put('Hello World')

        When migrating from :py:class:`~.Process`, activities are expressed as

        an environment - it is implicitly available. An activity can ``await``

        To run an activity, one must distinguish between a concurrent
        :py:class:`~usim.typing.Task` and a nested activity. When an activity
        exclusively waits for another activity, it can directly ``await`` it.

    On any change of events, ``evaluate`` is called with two arguments:

    This can be used to quickly test how many events have triggered:

    conditions are flattened. If *any* event fails, the :py:class:`~.Condition`
    fails with the same reason.

    .. note::

        The condition is only evaluated on instantiation and when child events

        **Migrating to μSim**

        Since conditions, such as a :py:class:`~.Flag`, may change their value,
        μSim does not support arbitrary comparisons. The common and well-defined
        :py:meth:`~.all_of` and :py:meth:`~.any_of` correspond to the ``&`` and ``|``
        operators.
