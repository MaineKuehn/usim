This module defines the exceptions exclusive to the SimPy compatibility layer.
These are used as shutdown signals between the environment and processes.
Note that with the exception of :py:exc:`~usim.py.exceptions.Interrupt`,
all signals are considered internal and are not meant to be handled manually.
